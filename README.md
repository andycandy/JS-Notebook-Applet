# JS Notebook Applet

[![Open in AI Studio](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/Open_in_AIStudio.svg)](https://aistudio.google.com/apps/bundled/get_started?showPreview=true)

A lightweight applet for [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) that enables users to write, run, and interact with JavaScript (JS) code in a notebook interface—similar to Python's Colab notebooks, but for JavaScript! This repo contains resources and documentation for the JS Notebook Applet.

---

## What is this?

This project provides a seamless way for users to:

- Write and execute JavaScript code interactively in cells.
- Explore modern JS/TS SDKs and AI capabilities in a notebook format.
- Share and remix notebooks, just like in Python Colab.

**Ideal for:**
- Learning and experimenting with JavaScript.
- Demonstrating code, tutorials, and AI model integrations.
- Rapid prototyping and sharing code snippets.
